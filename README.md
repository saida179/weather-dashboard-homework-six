# weather-dashboard-homework-six
I thought this homework was going to be easy but surprise it wasn't.
there was a lot of class activity that I tried to get ideas on how to use 
the JS for the API key, but of course I hit so rocks alone the way.
I know there must be and easy way of writing the JS, but my brain 
just goes blank when I'm doing this on my own and I know I will learn this third 
language I just wish there was more time.
